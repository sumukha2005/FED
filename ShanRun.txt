2. About Us
ShanRun Earthmovers began as a dream—a vision carried by a young entrepreneur determined to build something meaningful. In July 2023, Tharun Needig M. N., a 22-year-old from Mayasandra, set out on this journey armed with an ITI degree and an unwavering sense of purpose. His goal was never just to establish another company—it was to create something lasting, something that would stand as a testament to his hard work and dedication.

The beginning was far from easy. Tharun started alone, navigating the uncertainties of entrepreneurship with no prior experience to guide him. There were challenges at every turn, moments of doubt, and times when the weight of responsibility seemed overwhelming. But with determination as his strongest asset, he continued to push forward, refusing to let obstacles define his path.

Then,everything changed. His childhood friend, Shashank J,recognized the passion behind ShanRun Earthmovers and stepped in, not just as a partner but as someone who shared the same aspirations. With their combined efforts, the company took its first real steps toward growth. It was no longer just one man’s dream—it became a shared vision, strengthened by collaboration and trust.

Each day brought new lessons, hurdles to overcome, and victories to celebrate. Through persistence, adaptability, and a commitment to excellence, ShanRun Earthmovers carved out its place in the industry. The road ahead remains challenging, but for Tharun and Shashank, the journey is only just beginning. More than a business, ShanRun Earthmovers represents the belief that dreams, when pursued with determination and hard work, can take root and flourish.
Brick by brick, the legacy grows.
